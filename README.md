# Harmony Haven

This repository contains the development of **Harmony Haven**, a mobile game created as part of a task in the King & THU mentorship program. The game is designed to teach players about diversity and inclusion through interactive minigames, using iOS touchscreen capabilities to foster empathy and awareness in a fun and accessible way. While developing the game is a goal, the primary purpose of this repository is to document and track my progress in iOS programming.

## Project Description

Set on "Harmony Island," **Harmony Haven** allows players to explore a welcoming environment where diversity is celebrated. As players navigate the island, they engage in a series of unique minigames, each reflecting a different disability or human experience. Through these activities, players gain a deeper understanding of various challenges, with gameplay designed to be both educational and enjoyable.

## Game Features

- **Interactive Minigames**: Engaging activities that educate players on different human experiences and disabilities.
- **Exploration and Discovery**: Players can freely explore Harmony Island, unlocking minigames and interacting with NPCs.
- **Accessibility and Empathy**: The game is built with accessibility in mind, aiming to promote understanding and empathy through inclusive design.

## Development Progress

This repository serves as a place to document my journey of learning iOS programming. As I progress, I will update this space with new implementations, enhancements to the gameâ€™s minigames, exploration mechanics, and accessibility features. Each update will reflect my growing skills and understanding of iOS development.
